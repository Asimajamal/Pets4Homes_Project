                            <p>Adopting a dog is a wonderful thing to do but it's not a decision that should be taken
                                lightly. We've all seen the stickers “a dog is for life” and no truer words have ever
                                been written. A dog becomes a valued member of a family, they need the care and
                                attention they deserve and when they are sick, they need to go to the vet so they get
                                better as soon as they can. Adopting a dog means being able to offer a loyal, four
                                legged friend, a caring loving home - for life.

                                Things to Consider Before You Make the Big Decision
                                It's all too easy to fall in love with a dog that needs rescuing and you may do so with
                                all the best intentions. However, you really do need to ask yourself a few questions
                                before you take the plunge and offer a needy dog a caring place in your heart. The list
                                below consists of a few questions you need to ask yourself before you make the final
                                decision to dog from a rescue home.

                                Can You Afford To Keep a Dog?
                                Times are hard, so you need to ask yourself whether you can afford to keep a dog – you
                                have to think not only about the cost of the good quality food you would need to buy for
                                them, but there's vets bills and pet insurance to think about too. Then there's the dog
                                bed, blankets, ID tags, micro-chipping and not forgetting a few toys – all of which are
                                things you'll need to make sure a dog is healthy, happy and safe.

                                Do You Have Enough Time To Spend With a Dog?
                                Dogs need lots of love and attention. They need daily exercise and it's never enough to
                                just let them out in the back garden a couple of times a day. Dogs need physical
                                exercise but they need mental stimulation too, and depending on the breed, some more
                                than others!

                                Do You Live in a House or a Flat?
                                The breed and type of dog you adopt will very much depend on where you live and the type
                                of house or apartment you live in. Some dogs make great pets to have in a flat whereas
                                others do not – you would need to think carefully before making the right choice of dog
                                to suit your living environment.

                                Does Everyone In Your Household Want a Dog?
                                You need to be sure that everyone in the household is keen to share their home with a
                                dog. Remember dogs tend to shed fur on furniture, carpets and often come in wet with
                                muddy paws! You need to be sure the whole family is prepared and willing to spend time
                                taking care for your new dog, and this means grooming them, exercising them and most of
                                all loving them!

                                What Needs Doing Before You Bring a Dog Home
                                The best place to start looking for a rescue dog is on the Internet narrowing your
                                search to local dog rescue centres so that you don't have to travel too far to collect
                                them. You can search for dogs for adoption from local rescue centres on our Pets4Homes
                                site in the dog adoption section. The majority of rescue centres and shelters will ask
                                you to fill out a form so they can make sure the dog you decide to adopt has the right
                                temperament to suit your family and home environment.

                                You have to bear in mind that most dogs found in shelters and rescue centres have been
                                there for a while which means their characters, personalities, and everything to do with
                                their health has been evaluated by the centre. This helps when it comes to finding the
                                right home for the right dog. You will also have a visit from a member of staff who will
                                come to your home to make sure it is a safe place for a rescue dog to be re-homed to.
                                This is something that has to be done to ensure all dogs go to new and caring homes.
                                Everyone who wants to adopt a dog from a rescue centre gets a visit so there's nothing
                                to get upset or worried about.

                                Home Visits Explained
                                A home visit entails a member of staff from the rescue centre coming round to your home
                                to make sure it's a safe environment for a dog to live in. The things they'll check
                                include making sure the fencing around a garden is safe and secure so that a dog can't
                                escape. Generally speaking, the inspector will check the home environment you are
                                offering a rescue dog is a nice, caring and loving home.

                                The Things You Need To Get
                                Before you bring your dog home from the rescue centre, you will need to buy a few things
                                which includes the following:

                                Dog food – dry and tinned, making sure the food you buy is good quality
                                Dog bowls – both for food and water
                                Dog collar and lead
                                Dog bed – including a blanket or two
                                Dog ID tag – with name and address on it which you can buy from good pet stores who may
                                even be able to engrave them for you
                                Dog cage – for the car when travelling and in the home when training a young dog
                                Remember, you will need to take the collar and lead with you when you pick your dog up
                                from the rescue centre and you should put the dog cage in the back of your car, so your
                                new pet can travel in it on the way home so they are safe and secure.

                                Adopting An Adult Dog
                                There are many advantages to adopting an older dog, the first being you know exactly
                                what you are getting when it comes to size and temperament. The downside is you will
                                never really know about their past. The rescue will know where they came from and will
                                have got to know the dog, which means they can advise you of the dog's strengths and
                                weaknesses. The thing you have to bear in mind, is that your new pet will need lots of
                                time to settle in their new environments and you will need to show them loads of
                                patience until your new four legged friend understands and fits in to your routine.

                                The All Important First Day Home
                                Make sure the rescue centre has given you a report explaining the sort of diet and food
                                your new dog has been eating. The last thing you want to do is give them an upset tummy
                                by suddenly changing their diet. You need to have a nice quiet home environment when you
                                bring your dog home. If you have kids, they may be very excited at the fact a new dog is
                                arriving, but you need to explain to them that staying calm is really important when you
                                first arrive home with your dog.

                                It's a good idea to keep your new dog on a lead and if you have a garden, take them
                                outside because the chances are they will need to relieve themselves because of all the
                                excitement. Once they have settled down, you can let them off their leads and give them
                                lots of attention but in a nice calm manner.

                                The First Few Weeks – A Period of Adjustment
                                The first few weeks are important, it's going to be a period of adjustment both for you,
                                your family and your new rescued dog. It will be perfectly normal for them to feel a
                                little confused because they won't know what's expected of them in their new home. You
                                will need to be very patient with your new pet, and you will need to keep reassuring
                                them that everything is okay, even if there are few accidents!

                                The Things You Should Watch Out For
                                There may be a few things that you may find a little worrying when you first bring your
                                dog home, because initially they may be a little shy and show some anxiety as well as
                                restlessness. They may even drink more water than usual which means they'll need to go
                                to the toilet more – hence a few “accidents”. Stress may cause them to have a bout of
                                diarrhoea and they may lose their appetite. However, this is normal because everything
                                is so new to them, but should the symptoms go on for more than a couple of days, you
                                will need to contact your vet and take your dog along for a check-up.

                                Settling The Newest Family Member into Their New Home
                                After a week or so, your newest family member will have made your house their home. They
                                will have understood your routine and found their feet. However, every dog is different,
                                some may settle in very quickly whereas others may take a little longer. Sadly, some
                                dogs never manage to settle at all, but most do and very soon you will not be able to
                                remember what life was like without them – and the same could be said for a very
                                grateful rescue dog - sleeping happily in their warm bed, comfortably ensconced in your
                                home.</p>
